# Arabic-News-Detection
problem: With the rapid increase in digital news, it's important to classify articles accurately to help users find  information easily. This is especially challenging for Arabic news due to the language's complexity. The  aim is to develop a system that can accurately classify Arabic news articles into specific categories. â€¢

Solution:
To address this issue, a system was designed using various machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) models, including CNN, LSTM, BERT, and AraBERT. The SANAD dataset was used for training and evaluation. The system incorporated comprehensive preprocessing, word embedding techniques, and model selection to optimize classification performance. Data augmentation was applied to address imbalanced datasets, improving model accuracy. The final models, such as CNN, GRU, and AraBERT, achieved high accuracy, with the best models exceeding 93% accuracy
